## Overview and Project Goals

The goal of the final solo project of Mod 1 is to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

### What are the Learning Goals of the project?

#### To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

1. Writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. The difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. The interaction between multiple class files

## Code Architecture
Technology this project features:

1. The **index.html** file defines the structure of the content of the page.
2. A **game.js** and **player.js** file which stores the logic for game on the data model
3. The **main.js** file provides the functionality for the page in connection to the DOM
4. The **styles.css** file houses the style choices for the application

## Possible Future Additions

1. *New Game* functionality to reset the wins and start a new game
2. Additional functionality to allow for two human users to play against each other
3. A local storage feature could be implemented to save scores after page load

## Project Management

I used:
1. [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/dsweeny1/projects/1/views/1) to help plan out my methods
2. [Exalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to help get an idea of what I wanted my application to look like
